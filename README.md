## Building History

Wood Hall, the oldest building on Tamalpais High School’s campus and one of the most prominent buildings in Mill Valley, is named after E. E. Wood, the school’s first principal and founder.

On August 5, 1908, Tamalpais High School opened its doors with 64 students (including five seniors), three teachers, and Principal Ernest Everett "the Duke" Wood.  The building known as Wood Hall, now home to the Tam High’s administrative offices, in its early years housed classrooms and the school cafeteria.

The arches in many of the windows in Wood Hall were designed by students under the direction of Gerald T. Wendering, head of the Mechanical Drawing Department, who was responsible for designing many of the buildings at Tam High.

The clock tower was not originally part of the building, and was partially funded by the class of 1946 as a memorial to those Tam students who lost their lives in World War II. A plaque bearing 55 names was dedicated December 7, 1948. A chime was added by the class of 1986. 

Wood Hall was dedicated to Ernest E. Wood in 1954. In 1957 it was retrofitted to be earthquake proof. And in 1959 it underwent additional alterations.

During his 36 years as principal, Mr. Wood saw enrollment grow to 1,500 and watched the campus go from barren hillside to a stop on Grey Line Tours, which described it as the "most beautiful campus in the state of the California."
